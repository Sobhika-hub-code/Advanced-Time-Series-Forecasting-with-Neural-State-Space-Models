# Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning and Attention

This repository contains a complete project scaffold for multivariate time series forecasting using:
- Classical baseline: SARIMAX (statsmodels)
- Deep Learning: LSTM (PyTorch)
- Transformer-style model (PyTorch, simple temporal attention)

Contents:
- `data/` - generated synthetic dataset (CSV) (script to regenerate included)
- `src/` - scripts for data generation, preprocessing, models, training, evaluation, and inference
- `notebooks/` - starter notebook to run experiments and visualizations
- `artifacts/` - where models, scalers, and results will be saved
- `requirements.txt` - suggested dependencies

NOTE: This repo provides fully runnable code but **does not run training here**. To execute experiments, run the scripts locally or in your preferred environment.
